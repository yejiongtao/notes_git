		branches can overlap
		usually the branch containing the main line of development is called "master" branch
	sharing work
		when working alone, commit early and often, so you can explore different ideas and make changes freely
		but when you're going to share your work with others, 
			you may want to reorganize those commits, to make them well-factored with regard to reusability of the changes being made, and to give them meaningful, well-written commit messages
		pull  --pull changes from remote repositary
		push  --push changes to remote repositary
		clone  --get a full copy of the existing repository to work on
		remote-tracking branch
			containing the state of the remote repository on your latest pull
